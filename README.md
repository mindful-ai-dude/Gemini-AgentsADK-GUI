A professional, intuitive GUI application paired with a Flask backend for creating configurations for, testing, and managing AI agents using **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. Build powerful AI agents powered by Gemini models with custom tools, sub-agent interactions (agent-as-tool), and callbacks without needing deep ADK expertise for configuration.

> **IMPORTANT**: This project is created by Gregory Kennedy (https://aiforsocialbenefit.xyz | peacedude@gmail.com) and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google**. It is an independent tool designed to facilitate working with the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

## üåü Features

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.x or higher recommended)
- npm (v8.x or higher recommended)
- Python (v3.12 or higher recommended for ADK)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Google Cloud API Key with necessary permissions (e.g., Vertex AI API enabled)
- (Optional but Recommended) Google Cloud Service Account Key for the backend.

### Installation

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-agentsdk-gui-app.git # Use the new repo name
cd gemini-agentsdk-gui-app```

**2. Set up Frontend**
```bash
# Navigate to the root directory if not already there
pnpm install
```

**3. Set up Backend**
```bash
cd backend
# Create a Conda virtual environment (recommended)
# Make sure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed.
# Replace 'gemini-adk-env' with your preferred environment name.
# Replace '3.12' with your desired Python version if different (ADK recommends 3.12+).
conda create --name gemini-adk-env python=3.12 -y
conda activate gemini-adk-env

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure Google Cloud Credentials
# Rename .env.example to .env
# Edit .env and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY or set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path
# Optionally set GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
# Example using API Key in .env:
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy..........
# GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id

# To deactivate the Conda environment when you're done:
# conda deactivate

cd .. # Go back to the root directory
```

**4. Run the Application**

You need to run both the frontend and the backend concurrently.

*   **Terminal 1: Start Backend (Flask)**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    conda activate gemini-adk-env # Activate Conda env if not already active
    flask run --port 5001 # Or python app.py if flask run doesn't work
    ```
    *(Keep this terminal running)*

*   **Terminal 2: Start Frontend (React)**
    ```bash
    # In the root directory
    npm start
    ```

**5. Access the GUI**
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by React).

### Building for Production

*   **Frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The build files will be in the `build/` directory. Serve these static files using a web server (like Nginx, Caddy, or a cloud service).

*   **Backend:**
    The Flask backend should be deployed using a production-ready WSGI server (like Gunicorn or Waitress) behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx). Ensure the environment variables (`GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) are set in the production environment. See `docs/deployment.md` for more details.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Setting Up Your API Key

1.  When you first launch the application, you'll be prompted to enter your Google Cloud API key.
2.  Enter the key and click "Continue". The key is sent to the backend for validation.
3.  If valid, the key is stored *only* in your browser's local storage for the frontend to know validation passed. The backend uses credentials from its environment variables (`.env` or system environment) for actual API calls.
4.  You can test your Google Cloud API connectivity using the included test script (adapt as needed):
    ```bash
    # Example - script needs refinement for Google Cloud
    ./test-google-api.bat
    ```

### Creating Your First Agent Configuration

1.  Click the "Create Agent Config" button on the dashboard.
2.  Follow the step-by-step wizard:
    *   **Basic Details**: Set config name, description, and select a Gemini model. Configure model settings (temperature, TopP, TopK, etc.).
    *   **Instructions**: Define the agent's system prompt, guiding its behavior, persona, and task execution.
    *   **Tools**: Add built-in Google ADK tools (Google Search, Code Execution) or define custom Python function tools.
    *   **Sub-Agents (Agent-as-Tool)**: Configure references to other agent configurations that this agent can call as tools.
    *   **Guardrails (Callbacks)**: Configure Python callback functions to observe or modify agent behavior at specific lifecycle points (placeholder UI, requires backend implementation).
    *   **Code Preview**: View and copy/download the generated Python code (using Google ADK) based on your configuration.
    *   **Test Agent Config**: Interact with your agent configuration via the chat interface, which communicates with the backend Flask service running the ADK agent.

### Testing Your Agent Configuration

1.  Use the built-in test environment ("Test Agent Config" tab or "Test" button on the dashboard).
2.  Type messages and observe the agent's responses generated by the backend ADK execution.
3.  Check the backend terminal logs for detailed execution flow, tool calls, and callback triggers.
4.  Refine your agent configuration (instructions, tools, etc.) based on test results and save the changes.

### Deploying Your Agent

1.  Generate the Python code for your agent configuration using the Code Preview tab.
2.  Copy or download the `agent.py`, `instructions.py`, `tools.py` (if applicable) files.
3.  Use this code in your own Python application with the Google ADK installed.
4.  Set up the necessary Google Cloud credentials in your deployment environment.
5.  Use the Google ADK `Runner` (as shown in the generated runner/streaming examples) to interact with your agent.
6.  Refer to the official Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) documentation for advanced usage and deployment patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application now uses a client-server architecture:

### Core Components (Google ADK - Run by Backend)

- **Agent (google.adk.Agent)**: Core component defined in Python, powered by an LLM (Gemini). Uses instructions, tools, and potentially sub-agents/callbacks.
- **Runner (google.adk.runners.Runner)**: Executes agent invocations, manages the event loop, and interacts with services.
- **Tools (google.adk.tools...)**: Built-in capabilities (Google Search, Code Execution) or custom Python functions (FunctionTool, LongRunningFunctionTool) or other agents (AgentTool).
- **Callbacks (Python functions)**: Hooks into the agent lifecycle for observation or control.
- **SessionService (google.adk.sessions...)**: Manages conversation state and history.
- **InvocationContext / CallbackContext / ToolContext**: Provides context to execution logic and callbacks.

### Application Structure

- **React Frontend**: Built with React and Material UI for the user interface to *configure* agents.
- **Local Storage**: Agent *configurations* and UI settings are stored in the browser.
- **Flask Backend**: Python server using Flask.
    - Receives requests from the frontend (validate API key, run agent).
    - Instantiates and runs agents using the **Google ADK** based on the received configuration.
    - Interacts with Google AI services using backend credentials.
    - Returns results to the frontend.
- **API Communication**: Frontend communicates with the Flask backend via HTTP requests (fetch/axios).

## üîß Implementation Details

Key files involved in the refactoring:

- **`backend/app.py`**: The Flask application handling API requests and running ADK agents.
- **`backend/requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies for the backend (Flask, Google ADK, etc.).
- **`backend/.env`**: Stores Google Cloud credentials for the backend.
- **`src/utils/apiService.js`**: Frontend service making API calls to the Flask backend.
- **`src/components/AgentBuilder.js`**: Main UI component for configuring agents.
- **`src/components/builder/*`**: Sub-components for specific configuration steps (Tools, Instructions, SubAgents, Callbacks).
- **`src/components/AgentTester.js` / `src/components/builder/TestAgent.js`**: UI for interacting with the agent via the backend.
- **`src/utils/codeTemplates.js`**: Python code templates updated for Google ADK syntax.
- **`src/utils/tools.js`**: Definitions and examples of Google ADK built-in and custom tools.
- **`src/utils/modelOptions.js`**: Updated list of Google AI models (Gemini).
- **Documentation (`README.md`, `docs/*`)**: Updated to reflect Google ADK and the new architecture.
